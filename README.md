This plugin is based on Redmine Computed Custom Field [1.0.7](https://github.com/annikoff/redmine_plugin_computed_custom_field/releases/tag/v1.0.7) of Yakov Annikov.

This plugin is heavily reengineered to make its usage as secure as possible. Therefore, it is not compatible with the original plugin named *Redmine Computed Custom Field*.

Thanks to Yakov Annikov for the great idea of making custom fields computable.
